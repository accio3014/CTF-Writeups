```
$ bzip2 -d ch2.tbz2
$ tar -zxvf ch2.tar
```
The downloaded file was compressed in two different formats, so I extracted them. After extracting, I found a memory dump file. The problem's flag is described as "workstationâ€™s hostname," so I need to analyze the dump file to find the flag.<br />
<br />
Use the Volatility3 tool to analyze the memory.<br />
<br />

```
$ vol -f ch2.dmp windows.info
```
Using the windows.info option, I confirmed that the system is running Windows 7. <br />
Since the Volatility tool supports various plugins, I will use a plugin that checks the contents of registry keys to find the flag.<br />
<br />
<br />

```
$ vol -f ch2.dmp windows.registry.printkey --key "ControlSet001\\Control\\ComputerName\\ComputerName"
```

For Windows, the hostname is usually stored in the <br />
ControlSet001\\Control\\ComputerName\\ComputerName <br />
path. By using the windows.registry.printkey option to check the registry key contents, I was able to find the flag.<br />
<br />
